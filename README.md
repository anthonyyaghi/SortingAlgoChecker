# SortingAlgoChecker
This is a small tool to visualize sorting algorithms

Given a compiled java program that prints the state of the list/array being sorted at each step, this tool will generate a visual representation of the list at each step. Go step by step manually to check how the algorithm is working or run a small video animation.

Output of the sorting program:
